# Ratesapi gateway assessment

This project aims to demonstrate good coding practices.

Starting with an implementation of a rest api to retrieve and aggregate responses from an external service.

A simple thymeleaf has been added later, since additional time was available.

There are some gaps in the implementation due to time pressures and the late decision to include a ui.
The most significant gap is the omission of authentication between the UI and the API.
